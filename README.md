jQuery Presto plugin
====================

Select files and... Presto! Image previews!

Display **image previews from file inputs** before uploading or submitting.
It can work virtually on any browser/device because if all the attemps to
render images fail it falls back to uploading them asynchronously using the
iframe technique to get urls and display them anyway.
